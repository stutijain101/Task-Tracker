# Task Tracker

This Task Tracker project is a simple web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the browser's local storage to persist tasks even after the browser is closed. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with a user-friendly interface designed for ease of use.





## Features

- Add New Tasks: Users can enter tasks in an input field and add them to the list by clicking the "Add" button.
- Edit Existing Tasks: Each task can be edited by clicking the edit icon. The task's text will be loaded into the input field for modification.
- Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking the delete icon.
- Mark Tasks as Completed: Clicking on a task toggles its completion state, visually indicating completion with a strikethrough and disabling the edit option.
- Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist across sessions.
